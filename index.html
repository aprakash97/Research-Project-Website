                <h2>Project Introduction</h2>
                <p class="text-justify"> Any substance ingested to give nutritional support for a living being is referred to as food. Food is usually made up of carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, and minerals and is derived from plants, animals, or fungi. To give energy,
                    preserve life, or encourage growth, an organism consumes a material that is digested by the organism's cells. Because of the enormous variety of ingredients, foods, and personal tastes, food selection is a significant part of our everyday
                    activities. Choosing the right food at the right time appears to be a difficult task for many people.There are so many options, choosing food is a daily chore. We can't tell how anything is made merely by looking at it. However, with
                    the aid of image processing,

                    <br><br>we could accomplish something that humans couldn't. People are still oblivious to the nutritional worth, advantages, and disadvantages of their food choices in healthcare decision-making. Food has a calorie nevertheless, in
                    most meals, the consumer has no idea how many calories are in the food being provided. It is necessary to identify food. In a food picture, there are usually multiple varieties of food served, and it is possible to tell what food is
                    served from just one picture. Food selection is essential for specific purposes,

                    <br><br>such as a diet grading system, to prevent obesity, diabetes and others. Food references can be found through the food classification. Image classification is a challenge because the food image dataset is not linear; for example,
                    There is a food which has more similarities in look and taste, which is not the same, and there is also a food with another food which has similarities in types and forms of food.

                                Diabetes is a long-term health condition that affects how your body converts food into energy [4]. The majority of the food you eat is converted into sugar (also known as glucose) and released into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar rises, your pancreas
                                sends a signal to release insulin. Having too much glucose in your blood can lead to health problems over time. Although there is no cure for diabetes, you can take steps to manage it and stay healthy.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Diabetes is classified into several types. Diabetes is classified into three types: type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is typically diagnosed in children and young adults. Because type 1 diabetes can be passed down through families
                                (Genetics). If you are 45 or older, between the ages of 19 and 44, overweight or obese, and have one or more other diabetes risk factors, or a woman who has had gestational diabetes, experts recommend routine testing for
                                type 2 diabetes. Although type 2 diabetes most commonly affects adults, it can also affect children. Experts advise testing children aged 10 to 18 who are overweight or obese and have at least two other risk factors for
                                diabetes.
                            </p>

                                Glycemic Index (GI) plays a major part in food. Balancing high and low GI foods is one way to manage diabetes through dietary changes [1]. Foods with a high GI raise blood sugar levels more than foods with a low GI. Limit your intake of high GI foods
                                and pair them with sources of protein or healthy fat to reduce the impact on blood sugar and keep you feeling fuller for longer.

                                The A1C test, also known as the hemoglobin A1C or HbA1c test, is a straightforward blood test that measures your average blood sugar levels over the previous three months. It is one of the most commonly used tests for diagnosing prediabetes and diabetes,
                                as well as the primary test for assisting you and your health care team in managing your diabetes. Higher A1C levels have been linked to diabetes complications, so achieving and maintaining your personal A1C goal is critical
                                if you have diabetes.<br>

                                According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), the prevalence of diabetes among adults in Sri Lanka is 8.5 percent. Diabetes affects one in every twelve adults in the country, a total of 1.16 million people. People with diabetes can manage
                                their blood sugar levels by eating certain foods and avoiding others. A diet high in vegetables, fruits, and lean proteins can provide significant health benefits. Blood sugar levels can be raised by both sugary and starchy
                                carbohydrates. However, in the right amounts, these foods can contribute to a well-balanced diet. Many factors, including a person's activity level and medications, such as insulin, can influence the appropriate amount
                                and type of carbohydrates.

                                In the recommendation systems there are three types of techniques are used extensively for 
                                filtering.<br><br>

                                1. Content Based Filtering (CBF) <br>
                                2. Collaborating Filtering (CBF) <br>
                                3. Demographic Filtering (DF) <br><br>

                                The content based filtering technique uses similarities in features to make decisions. For 
                                instance, text recommendation systems which are used in the newsgroup system uses the 
                                words of their texts as features. This content-based recommender learns from the 
                                characteristics of the objects that the user has rated, a profile of user interest, known as 
                                "itemto-item correlation," and derives the type of user profile. In the collaborative filtering 
                                technique uses similarities between users and items simultaneously to make recommendation 
                                decisions. The main characteristic of this model is that it allowed generating 
                                recommendations based on a combination of ideas from the contributions of many other 
                                users. Instead of filtering items by content, make recommendations based on like-minded 
                                users’ reviews. Finally in demographic filtering it aims to classify the user based on personal 
                                characteristics and make recommendations based on demographic classes. For our research 
                                demographic filtering technique would be helpful rather than the other two techniques which 
                                are CBF and CF because this technique doesn’t require collecting complex data like user 
                                activities and don’t have to suffer from high computational power issues. Adding to that 
                                content filtering technique also often suffer from a main problem 
                                Cold start issues – Need bulky data from already created systems in order to provide precise

                                It has been established that some women are still hesitant to use social media platforms for fear of harassment, unwanted interactions, and cyberbullying. There are several such reasons cited by women who still do not have social media profiles This is
                                the primary motivation for creating a space for women.
                                <br><br> In an application designed for women, the gender should be verified in order to make sure that only females enter the system. This is a compulsory stage to follow before letting users inside the application.
                                <br><br> It's crucial to categorize the skills. This is because users may then select their own abilities or a skill area that interests them. If the user wants to learn new skills, she may choose a category and then browse
                                all of the learning resources and groups within that category. This is important since posts in a category should only be about that topic. A user who wishes to share and teach her skills can select the skill category to
                                which she belongs and then publishes material in that category. This categorization helps students and teachers to get the most out of the application.<br><br> Identifying a post which is professional and relevant to a
                                specific category is a challenging task. When people post in a group, they add some unnecessary and meaningless words, acronyms, and punctuation to express their feelings. Before the identification of relevant posts, text
                                preprocessing should be conducted. High accuracy matters to accept the processes.<br><br> In social media, most women are becoming the targets for crimes. Women's data was collected by the criminals and women are getting

                                When we think about our system, one of the primary unique ideas we'll examine is gender categorization and only letting female users into the system. That should be the particular goal that we set for our system. The gender classification would be this
                                part of the system's implementation. Gender classification refers to determining the gender of a user who is about to register with the system without having to ask them directly, by using trained models and machine learning
                                algorithms, as well as the idea of taking a selfie of the user with their identity card or passport if they are a foreign user. Identifying category-relevant words and their weights. We may be able to extract the identification
                                card number from the selfie and using the identity card number, we may be able to determine the gender. In Sri Lanka, a method for determining gender from the National Identity Card number existed. This should be a secondary
                                goal to ensure that the gender detection is accurate.
                                <br> This may also be broken down into other capabilities such as dataset collecting, dataset augmentation, machine learning model training, and gender categorization. The inner stages of extracting the facial features
                                and aligning those features on the face, as well as verifying using the picture on the Identity card number, are known as dataset augmentation. The models should be trained using a machine learning algorithm with a collection
                                of data containing both male and female photos obtained from the web, compared to sample models, and concluded with a trained dataset that could be utilized to properly determine gender.

                                1) Identification of Categories: Initially the main categories of skill set are to be identified. A research form is prepared, and direct interviews were hosted among women. The forms are circulated through social media and results are recorded. Direct
                                Interviews are held for the selected set of 50 individuals of age group above 18. This is to make sure that all the categories are to be included. As a result of this research, a list of categories is collected, and the
                                top 15 categories are taken to build the application initially. <br> (Note: The categories analyzed are - Cooking, Arts and crafts, Dance and Music, Education, Beauty, Fashion Designing,
                                Gardening, Homemaking, IT, Language, Defense, Sports and Exercise, Travelling, Baby care and Medicine) <br><br> 2) Collect words and their weights: Words are to be collected through three main methodologies and tf-idf vectorizer
                                is used to assign weights for these words. The weights are calculated manually as different ways are used to collect the related words. <br><br> 2.1) Social Listening: <br> Social media listening has been one of the most
                                powerful techniques to seek what people mention. Here the popular categories and related words should be searched, and the relevant posts can be identified. This covers popular mentions, brands and hashtags. Through this
                                social listening methodology maximum, relevant words can be identified through the following steps. ‘Media Toolkit’ is used for this purpose and the category relevant posts are collected by providing the most specific words
                                for reference. At the end of this, the posts related to each category are taken into a separate dataset. Then this dataset is set to the following:<br> a. NLP Preprocessing <br> The Dataset in initially preprocessed. This
                                includes <br> - Removing characters, patterns and links <br> - Removing twitter handles <br> - Removing short words <br> - Conversion to lower case <br> - Tokenization <br> - Lemmatization <br> - Stop word removal <br>                                b. Select Bag of words <br> After preprocessing, the frequency of each word is calculated and the words that appear more than a threshold limit are selected to be the bag of words.<br> c. Find TF-IDF Weights <br> The TF-IDF
                                vectorizer is used to find the weights of the words that we collected in (b). Based on the usage of the words TF-IDF weights are calculated in a manual way to get the words and weights to a separate file as output. <br>                                At the end of this process, we have a bag of words and their weights collected from social listening tools as an output. <br><br> 2.2) Web Scrapping: <br> Additionally, some more words related to the category are collected
                                through web scrapping. Scrapy is used to scrape the data. In our process, we do web scrapping for two purposes. The first purpose is to find the top words related to the category from the category-specific websites. Initially,
                                scrape the websites to get the category relevant reviews, comments and instructions. For example, for the cooking category; the comments on major cooking websites, instructions of cooking, idioms related to cooking are
                                collected. Then these terms are undergone the preprocessing, frequency calculation and tf-idf weight calculation as we did in the social listening part. The next purpose of web scraping is to identify the confirmed words
                                related to a category. For example, for the cooking category; the names of ingredients, foods, cooking appliances and fast-food chains can be considered as confirmed words for cooking. Therefore, these words are collected
                                from the websites (mainly Wikipedia) and preprocessing is done to confirm the similarity. The weight of these words should be higher because they are confirmed to be category-specific. Therefore, after calculating the tf-idf
                                weights in the previous stages, the maximum weight of the words is extracted and given as the weight to these confirmed words. At the end of this stage, there will be two similar types of files like social listening output,
                                which has the words and weights. One will be the output of web scraping from websites and confirmed words from websites. <br><br> 3) Finding similar words: Sometimes the synonyms of the words can be used to refer to a word
                                that is relevant to a category. In this case, the synonyms of the words extracted from social listening and web scrapping are to be identified. The synonyms of confirmed words are skipped because to reduce the category
                                of irrelevant words in the content. Similar words can be synonyms, antonyms, associations, domain-specific words and shortened words. WordNet a lexical database designed for Natural Language processing can be used for finding
                                out similar words with associated frequencies. The weight assignment here is done differently. As tf-idf weights should be used, initially a fixed value of 1 is given as the frequency for each similar word identified. This
                                is to make sure that the word appears at least once in the content. Then the dataset used in the social-listening phase is reused here to identify the weights based on tf-idf vectorizer. In the end, the top words and similar
                                words make up the bag of words. Through these methodologies, the words are collected with weights. These outputs are finally emerged as one file to give the words and weights related to each category. If a word appears
                                more than once, then one of the duplicates is deleted and the other word is given with the maximum weight of the word. (E.g.: cook – 3.4367, cook – 2.5654; Here the word cook appears twice. So, the one with the minimum
                                weight is deleted. Finally, the cook – 3.4367 is taken as the word and weight) <br>

                                Once the words and weights are found, this should be used to categorize the post. The users are required to post only category-specific posts. The application provides the ability to a user to create pages of different categories. (E.g.: A user can have
                                any number of pages like Page A which is of the cooking category and Page B of the Fashion category. If a user wants to post a cooking-related post, then she can only post on Page A or create a new page of cooking category
                                and post. If she tries to post it on Page B, then the system will not allow it because the categories don’t match) For this purpose, the application allows to user to either select a category and post after the application
                                test for the category and allows to post, or the user can automate the process and ask the application to select the most suitable category. <br> The post can be either a text, image or video
                                with a compulsory description. When categorizing these posts both the content of a post and the description should be considered. Any post like text post, image post and video post should be first converted to raw text.
                                This is done through the following methods <br><br> Option 1: If text post <br> If the post is a text, then this text is appended with the description and then taken to test the category. <br> Option 2: If image post <br>                                If the post is an image, then the image is converted to raw text through the tesseract optical character recognition library. Then this converted text is appended to the description and taken to test the category. <br>                                Option 3: If video post <br> If the post is of type video, then the video is analyzed and if the video has voice instructions, then through Speech recognition and MoviePy libraries the video is converted to audio and then
                                into text. Or if the instructions are in subtitles, then using OpenCV the video is broken into frames and the text is extracted individually and merged to make a full text. Then this text appended to the description.
                                <br><br> In the case of different languages lang detector library can be used to identify the language and google translate library can be used to convert that to English for testing. After generating the post data, it
                                should be preprocessed and then the category is found in the below methods. <br><br> 1) Best fitting category: <br>This method works if the user doesn’t specify a category and asks the application to choose the best category
                                to which the post belongs. Finding the best fitting category works on the sum of weights for each word in the post. Here the weights of words in the post are tested whether it appears in each weight file for an individual
                                category and if the word is present then the associated weight is noted and added up together. The same method is followed for each category. Finally, the category that possesses the maximum tfidf score for the post will
                                be the category of the post. This is an algorithmic way to find the category of the post. Through this process, the best category that fits the post is identified using the tf-idf weight scores.<br><br> 2) Category verification:<br>                                Here the user chooses the category and tries to post within that category. In this case, the application should test whether the post fits that category. If it fits, then the post will get posted or it gets rejected. <br>                                Three machine learning algorithms are to be used here and finally; the most accurate algorithm will be taken into use. <br><br> a. Naïve Bayes <br> In Naïve Bayes the defined weight with words is generated in a sparse matrix
                                probability graph and considered as the training data set. This probability is then combined with the contribution of the words in the post text, forming the likelihood estimate for each of the words. The word with the
                                highest likelihood estimate is then the assigned word for the new frequency. <br> b. Logistic Regression <br> Here the threshold value is considered. Any post having the probability value above the threshold is considered
                                as category relevant or it is category irrelevant. <br> c. Support Vector Machine <br> Support Vector machine provides a clear-cut value of whether the text belongs to the category or not. In the end, the accuracy is tested
                                among these classifiers and a highly accurate one is chosen.<br>

                                1) Location Clustering: By using this method, it’s expected to protect the location privacy of the users. Users need to provide their addresses while registering for the app. From that address, the system will take the city as the input. By using the
                                Geopy geocoders library, the system will predict the user’s city’s latitude and longitude. By using the predicted latitude and longitude, the system will map the location in a world map. For this purpose, folium is used.
                                By having Sri Lanka as the central location, the rest of the other location coordinates will get plotted on the map. Then the K-means clustering algorithm is used to cluster the location. By using the silhouette score method,
                                the maximum accuracy of 80% is gained while clustering the coordinates into four clusters. Right after plotting the coordinates in the world map, the distribution of the users’ locations all over the world is visible. The
                                privacy policies can be adjusted based on the user’s location. Also, after clustering the locations into different clusters, the developed method will list only the cluster numbers as the user location. All the other location
                                data will get hidden so that the locations couldn’t be identified using the cluster labels.<br><br> 2) Skill clustering: This method also uses the k-means algorithm for clustering purposes.
                                Users can select their interested skill categories in the application. The system will cluster the users who have similar interests. So that, users who have similar interests could interact with each other. The system will
                                assign weights according to the selected skills. For example, if the user selects cooking as the first skill, then that skill will get multiplied by 25, if the user selects dancing as the second skill, then that skill will
                                get multiplied by 15, other skills will get the same application but will get multiplied by numbers that are smaller than previously assigned numbers since the priority decreases. The summation of those numbers will be
                                50. After multiplication, those skills will get listed in binary number format. For example, the result will get shown as a matrix in which the skills will consist of 1 and 0. As mentioned earlier, if the user selects cooking
                                as the first skill, the matrix will contain number 1 twenty-five times, the dancing will have number 1 fifteen times. The skills that have not to get selected by the user will get zero as the default value. Other skills
                                will also have 1 and 0 according to the assigned priority. According to the assigned numbers, the system will find the mean value of every skill based on the priority. Based on the mean value, the k-means clustering algorithm
                                will cluster the mean values. People who are getting clustered into those clusters are allowed to interact with users who belong to the very same clusters.<br><br> 3) Data anonymization: While registering, users could provide
                                sensitive details like their first name, last name, email address, phone number and age. To protect these details, faker library is used. Faker library can generate fake data for a given set of data. Faker contains prebuilt
                                functions to anonymize data. Here, the developed system calls those functions to anonymize data that has been provided by the users. After anonymizing, the original data will get replaced as another set of data. For example,
                                if the user enters their first name as “Sedan” while registering, the name will get changed to “Roman.” But the created data set and the original data will not get mixed, so there are no chances for confusion. So, the anonymized
                                data can help protect the user’s sensitive data.<br><br>
